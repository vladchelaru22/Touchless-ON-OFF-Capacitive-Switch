# Touchless-ON-OFF-Capacitive-Switch
College Project made during CAD Circuit Design class.

Using a given set of parameters, a physical circuit and schematic, I translated the circuit into an OrCAD schematic and produced PCB Design of the circuit using both SMT and THT - using either common PCB Footprints or creating some of my own
Exported the electrical and mechanical layers, with their respective Gerber files, making the project ready to print and fabricate.
